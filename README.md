Create a sunburst chart using novem

This repo shows some basic example code of how a sunburst chart can be created 
using novem and d3.js. Most of the d3 code is located in the `custom_sunburst` 
folder and the process.py script show how that code can be loaded to novem.

## Example script

The example script also produces a couple of aggregation charts that gets
shared with `chat` so it can be interacted with using minerva.
